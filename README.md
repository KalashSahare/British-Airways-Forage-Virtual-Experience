### Task 1 Web scraping to gain company insights

Scrape and analyse customer review data to uncover findings for British Airways

British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether it’s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.

#### Scrap data from the website https://www.airlinequality.com/ 
The first thing to do will be to scrape review data from the web. For this, you should use a website called Skytrax.
#### Analyse data
Prepare data. 

The data contain purely text. 

Perform data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. 

When the data is clean, perform your own analysis to uncover some insights. 

As a starting point, look at topic modelling, sentiment analysis or wordclouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews.
#### Present insights
summarise your findings within a single PowerPoint slide.
### Task 2 Predicting customer buying behaviour

Build a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour

#### Explore and prepare the dataset
First, spend some time exploring the dataset in the “Getting Started” Jupyter Notebook provided in the Resources section below to understand the different columns and some basic statistics of the dataset. Then, you should consider how to prepare the dataset for a predictive model. You should think about any new features you want to create in order to make your model even better. You can make use of the Resources provided to get you started with this task. 

#### Train a machine learning model
When your data is ready for modelling, you should train a machine learning model to be able to predict the target outcome, which is a customer making a booking. For this task, you should use an algorithm that easily allows you to output information about how each variable within the model contributes to its predictive power. For example, a RandomForest is very good for this purpose.

#### Evaluate model and present findings
After training your model, you should evaluate how well it performed by conducting cross-validation and outputting appropriate evaluation metrics. Furthermore, you should create a visualisation to interpret how each variable contributed to the model. Finally, you should summarise your findings in a single slide to be sent to your manager. Use the “PowerPoint Template” provided in the Resources section below to create your summary and make use of the links provided to help with this task.
